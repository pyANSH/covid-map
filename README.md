Technical Stack
The COVID Info web application is built using the following technologies:
VITE: A build tool and development server that is used to build the application. Docs : Vite | Next Generation Frontend Tooling (vitejs.dev)
React: A JavaScript library that is used to build the user interface of the web application. Docs: https://react.dev/
TypeScript: A statically typed language that is used to write the code for the application. Docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

Tailwindcss:Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML1. Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be1. The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Tailwind CSS from scratch is with the Tailwind CLI tool. Docs : https://tailwindcss.com/
